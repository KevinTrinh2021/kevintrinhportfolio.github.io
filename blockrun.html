    <p class="blockrunp1">Just recently before 2019's President's day, I got interested in game development. Becoming interested in this area of developing, I decided to design a small and simple game called Block Run. Purpose of this game project was to get me more exposed to the graphics designs side of coding and developing as well as rendering design sides as well.
 Starting off with the research, I selected unity as my platform of designing & game engine, as well as C# for my scripts. With the help of tutorials and web guides, I began designing and linking scripts. I then started making multiple components and scripts, then later linking them both to give my components a function as well as trigger certain functions within my codes. Finishing my levels and components as instructed in the videos, I decided to add additional things to the game from extra 3D parts/in-game props to extra movement and velocity options. Although it would seem difficult to add extra codes and more designs to the game without detailed instructions, I managed to script my jump velocity, as well as extra game obstacles with the knowledge of my older parts and codes that I recently did at the beginning of my game designing. After finishing and testing all parts & levels within the game, I ran through the build/exporting process of my unity game with both windows download and a WebGL importing. After exporting I registered my windows download through a free transforming program to set up my download (x86 style/32-bit)  as well as importing my game files to HTML & CSS. (game files were turned into HTML codes for my WebGL in the unity software) From there, I got the necessary texts and added it to my current text editor as well as moving the game files to my portfolio folder and setting up correct pathways for the text to find specific parts of the game as needed.
Overall, in my opinion, I thought the game was really interesting as my first unexperienced project. Although creating the maps were somewhat fun, I enjoyed designing and rendering the game obstacle props the most, as well as importing the game HTML and CSS files to my website.
Learning a lot from this small project, im glad I learned how to use a minimal amount of the basics of unity and a very minimal amount of C# script editing as well. In the future, I do hope to design more complicated games and learn more within the unity program as well as C# commands.
