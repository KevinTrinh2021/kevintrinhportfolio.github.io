    <h1 class="developingh1">Developing Intro</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p class="developingp1">Welcome to my developing page! Here I will be posting and uploading my projects relating to developing and coding etc. (projects may also be located in different areas within my site based on classes etc) As of my sophomore year (2018-2019), I began coding near the beginning of January after viewing over a site called Code Academy. Getting interested, I decided to start off with something simple and easy, so I started watching a couple tutorials on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS to begin my own portfolio website instead of hosting within a Wix domain or a Google sites. Starting off this journey, I was lucky to have an experienced guide to help me choose a platform to host (Github) as well as fixing multiple code errors that I've made etc. After getting familiar with a fair amount of the HTML & CSS language, I decided to attempt another language in a different field and get exposed to other tasks such as coding scripts and rendering out games etc. From there, I decided to dedicate my own development page within my portfolio for my future projects as well. Starting off, coding was just a hobby, although after some researching and snooping around within experiences from other developers, I realized that I might enjoy persuing a CTE pathway within the development side. (also this might sound ridiculous, but I also somewhat wanted to show off to my friends that I can somewhat code)
