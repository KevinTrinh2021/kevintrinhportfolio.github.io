    <h1 class="charretteh1">Charrette Assembley</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="charrettep1">of the project was to assemble in groups to resolve a given scenario. Me being the Building Inspector, our scenario was to build a city or town on a given piece of land as efficient and safe as possible. With many roles as an environmental engineer, building inspector, architecture, Banker etc, we gathered around and discussed many different ways to design a great and safe city. After discussing and recording all our thoughts, we designed a poster with all our plans on a sticky note and posting it on the poster. after designing our chart poster and linking all the sticky notes together using lines, my group and i presented our thoughts and plans to the class on how we thought of an efficient way to make a city on the given land provided without disturbing the environment too much as well as other things to consider when creating a city. Overall, I had no complaints with the assignment, and I'm glad to have gotten the chance to work with new people and get to know them better within my class, as well as learning the process of a charrette and the uses and advantages of assembling as a group with a large diversity of people with different perspectives to construct an efficient plan.</p>
