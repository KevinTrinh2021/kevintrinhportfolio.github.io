    <p class="iedp1"> Welcome to my Intro to Engineering home page. Part of the PLTW/ Project Lead The Way organization, I took this class as one of my electives for my freshmen year of high school. After finishing both semesters of this class and receiving its credits, I'm happy to say that I had a positive experience within this class. Being with a diverse class, I had a great time participating in the projects that were assigned, as well as all the assignments that were completed. Mostly what my class and I did in the course was learning the foundations of engineering. From constraints to principles etc, we worked mostly on a CAD program as well as a majority of time on our Engineering PLTW notebooks as well. Most of everything we were assigned was also located on Schoology. Overall, I hope to complete the next 3 stages of this class as well as moving on to CEA (civil engineering & architecture) as of my sophomore year.</p>
