<p class="aboutmep2">Greeting you, welcome to my official about me page. As you know, my name is Kevin Trinh, and I'm currently 16 and attending Dobie highschool as a sophomore. Currently, I live with both parents and my little brother, as well as my other step brother which shows up every week or two. I'm currently taking a CTE path with the hope of soon getting to work at a developing/programming company. In my free time, I enjoy playing a diverse set of games as well as heading outside and play in some team games of basketball football etc. (non-competitive) Thank you for visiting my portfolio site, browse around my site and view my past & recent projects.</p>

    <p class="aboutmep"> Currently, I'm a high school student trying to approve my studies on engineering and designing etc. At the moment, im trying to take as many computer science or engineering related classes as possible. A hope of mine is too soon have a job in the engineering or technological fields weather a web developer or a software engineer etc. Throughout my experiences of these categories of classes is that I enjoy designing and composing things from a CAD program to a website etc. Although I currently don't hold a large achievement, over my minor years of experience from my classes and projects, I will have to say my largest achievement is going to be when I had to work with a small team on a
      <a href="reverse.html" target="_blank" class="replink">reverse engineering project</a>
      . This project took place shortly after my class and I learned the basics of CAD. Being partnered up randomly, my team consisted of a total of just three people. Starting the project, we were given very minimal and limited time. We started off executing the paper analysis of the project. from the first task, I started to notice that I was paired up with two dudes that slacked off too much. Ignoring it, soon I later realized how much time was available until our presentation date as well as how much work we have completed as a team. Although my team wasn't too responsible for their grades from the looks, after finally completing the paper part of our project we quickly started planning and designing our product on the Computer Aided Design program. With only a total of 2 class periods left on separate days each, we only had about 2/3 of an hour per each period to design and draft our projects as well as inspect its properties. Surprisingly, we were able to design all six parts as well as finish the drafts etc. After the presentation of our project, I was well convinced that my team was pretty skilled on designing these parts efficiently based on the limited time we had as well as acknowledging that they were very hardworking when it came to the designing & drafting sides of things. Overall, the project did teach me some lessons as well as time managing etc. Hopefully, in the future depending on the paths/classes im going to take, my goal is to become a software engineer or web developer, although jobs in the technological field will do.
