    <p class="ceap1">Thank you for visiting my Civil Engineering and architecture page. As of my sophomore year, unfortunately, I only participated in two months worth of this PLTW CEA elective class. Because of money problems and other such things, I moved schools resulting in different classes etc. With only two months worth of activities, we did quite a couple of projects. From learning architecture styles to roof types etc as well as concrete padding, rebar etc. An example of one project we started off the school year with, was a project on architectural styles. With me drawing the international architecture style,  after research and compiling a presentation, I presented my style as well as all my other peers as we recorded what we found from other styles as well. We then created a model of our style, as well as attach our style features label on the model too. After all models complete, we had a whole day where everyone gathered around multiple tables full of all models and had to guess what model corresponded with what style. With an example of what this class revolved around, after moving schools, The best option I had closest to any engineering class was interior design & architecture. Its been months in this class, and I highly don't recommend this class, although this class hardly learned anything other than color schemes and design elements and principles all year, It barely touched anything on the architectural side of things. (class wasn't challenging enough to keep people interested) Feel free to check out all subpages to this page for you will see all my projects within both these classes.</p>
