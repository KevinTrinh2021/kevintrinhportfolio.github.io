      <p>Hey, my name is Kevin Trinh. I'm currently a junior at Dobie High school and am currently trying to improve my studies in development and codes through classes as well as working towards obtaining a designing and development job. Currently, I do Web designing and scripting of small applications as a hobby and practice. I'm normally very energetic and enjoy going out to play ball or go swimming or even doing anything fun to burn energy and time.</p>

    <h2 id="education-h2">My education</h2>
      <p class="education-p">In terms of education, I'm currently attending Dobie HS as my junior year. My goal is to continue in computer science and design majors as well as obtaining a job within this field. As of my freshman year, I went to shadow creek high school and participated in the PLTW engineering program for about 1.5 years. As the second semester of my sophomore year approaching, I exchanged schools to J Frank Dobie HS and may continue to finish off my secondary school years here till graduation. During this time in secondary school, I will be participating in my schools offered programming and computer science classes as well as higher-level core classes to improve my GPA. After graduation, I hope to attend one of my top three colleges consisting of Houston University, Texas A&M, or Texas Tech University.
